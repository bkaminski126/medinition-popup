          Colds vs. allergies: How to tell the difference
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          Since colds and allergies have many of the same symptoms, it may be
          hard to tell the two conditions apart.

          A cold, also known as the common cold, is caused by a virus. Many
          different types of viruses are responsible for colds. While the
          symptoms and severity may vary, colds generally share some basic
          characteristics. Despite its name, you can get a cold at any time of
          the year, even in summer. The Centers for Disease Control and
          Prevention (CDC) estimate that the average healthy adult gets two or
          three colds per year.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          Allergies occur when your immune system has an adverse reaction to
          certain substances. When youâ€™re exposed to an allergy trigger, known
          as an allergen, your immune system releases multiple chemicals called
          histamine. This release of histamine is what causes allergy symptoms.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          Every year, more than 50 million U.S. adults experience allergies.
          Seasonal allergens such as tree, grass, and weed pollen are common
          triggers, but you might be allergic to certain substances year-round.
          Other allergy triggers can include:{" "}
